==================================================
PERFORMANCE COMPARISON
==================================================
KNN Collaborative Filtering RMSE: 2.4431
Item-Based Collaborative Filtering RMSE: 1.7156
Item-Based approach performs better (lower RMSE)

Sample Predictions from KNN:
Sample 1: Actual=4.0, Predicted=2.00, Error=2.00
Sample 2: Actual=4.0, Predicted=2.88, Error=1.12
Sample 3: Actual=3.0, Predicted=2.25, Error=0.75
Sample 4: Actual=3.0, Predicted=1.25, Error=1.75
Sample 5: Actual=4.0, Predicted=3.25, Error=0.75

Sample Predictions from Item-Based:
Sample 1: Actual=4.0, Predicted=5.00, Error=1.00
Sample 2: Actual=3.0, Predicted=2.54, Error=0.46
Sample 3: Actual=3.0, Predicted=4.65, Error=1.65
Sample 4: Actual=4.0, Predicted=5.00, Error=1.00
Sample 5: Actual=2.0, Predicted=5.00, Error=3.00

4c) Comprehensive Analysis

==================================================
COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS
==================================================
Additional Metrics:
KNN Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 2.1653
Item-Based Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 1.3594
KNN Coverage: 42.3%
Item-Based Coverage: 39.4%

KEY FINDINGS:

1. MATRIX SPARSITY:
   - Original matrix sparsity: 98.30%
   - High sparsity is the main challenge for collaborative filtering

2. RECOMMENDATION PERFORMANCE:
   - KNN RMSE: 2.4431
   - Item-Based RMSE: 1.7156
   - Lower values indicate better prediction accuracy

3. PRACTICAL INSIGHTS:
   - Both methods struggle with extreme sparsity
   - Item-based approach often handles cold-start better
   - KNN can be more accurate when sufficient data exists

4. RECOMMENDATIONS:
   - Consider hybrid approaches combining both methods
   - Matrix factorization could improve performance
   - Content-based features would help with cold-start
   - Regularization techniques needed for sparse data
